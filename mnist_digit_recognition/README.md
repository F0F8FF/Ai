# MNIST Classification with CNN

A PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying MNIST handwritten digit images.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple CNN model to classify MNIST dataset digits (0-9). The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images. The model is trained using PyTorch and achieves decent accuracy on the test set.

### Features
- Data preprocessing with normalization
- Custom CNN architecture
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy display on test data

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Other dependencies in `requirements.txt` (see below for details)
