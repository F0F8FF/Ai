# Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

This project focuses on classifying movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build an LSTM-based deep learning model.

## Key Features
- Sentiment analysis using movie review data
- Text preprocessing (tokenization and padding)
- LSTM-based deep learning model for classification
- Sentiment prediction for new reviews

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 3.7+
- **TensorFlow** 2.x
- **Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation (if needed)
- **NumPy**: For array operations
