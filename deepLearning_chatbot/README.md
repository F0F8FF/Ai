# Deep Learning Korean Chatbot

A Korean chatbot implemented with PyTorch and deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Neural network-based response generation
- Pattern recognition and context understanding
- Customizable conversation data
- Probability-based response selection
- Real-time chat interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer
- Multiple Hidden Layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout for preventing overfitting
- Output Layer with Softmax
- Cross-Entropy Loss function
- Adam Optimizer

## Training Data
The chatbot is trained on a custom dataset (`chatbot_data.json`) containing:
- Greetings
- Goodbyes
- Weather-related conversations
- Food-related discussions
- Mood and emotions
- General responses
