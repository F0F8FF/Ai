# GAN for MNIST Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digit images similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training.

---

## Features
- Generates realistic MNIST-style digit images.
- Utilizes a generator and discriminator for adversarial training.
- Saves and displays generated images during training.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 3.7+
- **TensorFlow** 2.x
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing generated images
- **NumPy**: For array operations
